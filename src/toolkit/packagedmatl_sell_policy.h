/// MatlSellPolicy performs semi-automatic inventory management of a material
/// buffer by making offers and trading away materials in an attempt to empty
/// the buffer's inventory every time step.
///
/// For simple behavior, policies virtually eliminate the need to write any code
/// for resource exchange. Just assign a few policies to work with a few buffers
/// and focus on writing the physics and other behvavior of your agent.  Typical
/// usage goes something like this:
///
/// @code
/// class YourAgent : public Facility {
///  public:
///   ...
///
///   void EnterNotify() {
///     Facility::EnterNotify(); // always do this first
///
///     policy_.Init(this, &outbuf_, "outbuf-label").Set(outcommod).Start();
///   }
///   ...
///
///  private:
///   MatlSellPolicy policy_;
///   ResBuf<Material> outbuf_;
///    ...
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// The policy needs to be initialized with its owning agent and the material
/// buffer that is is managing. It also needs to be activated by calling the
/// Start function for it to begin participation in resource exchange.  And
/// don't forget to add some commodities to offer on by calling Set.  All policy
/// configuration should usually occur in the agent's EnterNotify member
/// function.
///
/// @warn When a policy's managing agent is deallocated, you MUST either
/// call the policy's Stop function or delete the policy. Otherwise SEGFAULT.
